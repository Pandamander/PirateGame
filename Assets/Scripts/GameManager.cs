DONE:
Fix running

NEXT UP:

Make the final stage break the floor
Have a collection of floors

Make it so that the cracks time out, fill the floors, then you lose



5:22 - scritable object data setup

Add the camera shake again



P2 IDEAS:
Get a hammer that lets you repair faster
Other pirates attacking, shooting cannonballs
Skeletons
Big and small leaks

BUG: Jumping animation doesn't work. Maybe make your own movement system?
